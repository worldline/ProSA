# ProSA - Protocol Service Adaptor

<img class="logo" alt="Worldline" src="worldline.svg" height="20">

ProSA is an open-source Rust implementation of Worldline's service provider solution.
ProSA was designed to provide a simple and lightweight protocol service adaptor for service-oriented architectures and to offer a flexible and scalable platform for developing and deploying microservices. This allow developers to focus on writing business logic while ProSA takes care of the underlying infrastructure concerns.
