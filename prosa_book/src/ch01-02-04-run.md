# Run ProSA

Once you have created a binary using `cargo-prosa`, the next step is to run this binary.

If you've installed a package or a container, you don't need to understand the internal workings.
However, if you want to execute the binary manually, this section explains the available parameters.

When you run `prosa_binary -h`, you'll see output like the following:
```
Usage: prosa_binary [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --dry_run                   Show how the ProSA will run but doesn't start it. Write the config file if it doesn't exist
  -d, --daemon
  -c, --config <CONFIG_PATH>      Path of the ProSA configuration file [default: prosa.yml]
  -n, --name <NAME>               Name of the ProSA
      --user <USER>               User:Group to run the daemon ProSA
  -l, --log_path <LOGPATH>        Path of the output log
  -t, --worker_threads <THREADS>  Number of worker threads to use for the main [default: 1]
  -h, --help                      Print help
  -V, --version                   Print version
  ```

Based on this, you have several options:

- dry_run: Use this option to test your configuration file or create it if it doesn't exist.
- daemon: Run ProSA as a daemon. If you have configured [stdout](http://localhost:3000/ch01-02-01-observability.html#stdout) in your observability settings, a log file will be created.
- config: Specify the path to your configuration folder/file.
- name: Override the name in your prosa settings. This sets the name of your ProSA instance.
- user: Useful for running ProSA as a daemon. This option allows you to specify the user under which the ProSA process will run.
- log_path: Also useful when running ProSA as a daemon. This option creates files in the specified folder where logs will be saved.
- worker_threads: Specify the number of threads allocated for ProSA. Each processor can launch threads individually; thus, this option may have varying effects depending on your processor's capabilities.
- version: Provides information about the binary crate version as well as the versions of all components used. For example:
```bash
$ prosa_binary -V
prosa 0.1.0
$ prosa_binary --version
prosa 0.1.0 - core::main::MainProc = { crate = prosa, version = 0.2.0 }
  inj
    Processor: inj::proc::InjProc = { crate = prosa, version = 0.2.0 }
    Adaptor  : inj::adaptor::InjDummyAdaptor = { crate = prosa, version = 0.2.0 }
  stub
    Processor: stub::proc::StubProc = { crate = prosa, version = 0.2.0 }
    Adaptor  : stub::adaptor::StubParotAdaptor = { crate = prosa, version = 0.2.0 }
```
