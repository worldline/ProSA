# Introduction

Welcome to the ProSA ecosystem.
This book will help you run and build a ProSA.

## Who ProSA is for

ProSA is ideal for people who want to run and build transactional systems.


## How to use this book

This book is organised in three main topics:

- OPS: To give you all the assets you need to run your ProSA

- Adaptor: A section for application developers who want to use the existing ProSA ecosystem and build their applications around it

- Processor: For more advanced developers who want to add new processors in ProSA.

These topics assume that you're reading them in sequence from OPS through Adaptor to Processor. Later chapters build on concepts from earlier chapters.
It's important that you understand concepts from previous chapters if you want to dive into a specific topic.

- OPS people only need to understand the OPS chapter

- Applicative developers need to read OPS and Adaptor chapters

- More advanced developers need to read this book in its entirety
