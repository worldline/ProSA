# Introduction

Welcome to the ProSA ecosystem.
This book will help you run and build a ProSA.

## Who ProSA is for

ProSA is ideal for people who want to run and build transactionnal systems.


## How to use this book

This book is organised in three main topics:

- OPS: To give you all assets you need to run your ProSA

- Adaptor: A section for application developpers who want to use the existing ProSA ecosystem and build their applications around it

- Processor: For more advanced developpers who want to add new processors in ProSA.

These topics assumes that you're reading them in sequence from OPS through Adaptor to Processor. Later chapters build on concepts from earlier chapters.
It's important that you understand concepts from previous chapters if you want to dive into a specific topic.

- OPS people only need to understand the OPS chapter

- Applicative developpers need to read OPS and Adaptor chapters

- More advanced developpers need to read everything
