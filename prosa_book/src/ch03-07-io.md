# I/O

Since ProSA is designed to connect to external systems, helpers for I/O operation are essential.

This page covers I/O from server and client perspectives, with a few examples.

## Listener

[`StreamListener`](https://docs.rs/prosa/latest/prosa/io/listener/enum.StreamListener.html) type is used to handle server sockets.
It can be instantiated from a [`ListenerSetting`](ch01-02-03-stream.md#listener) using the [`bind`](https://docs.rs/prosa/latest/prosa/io/listener/struct.ListenerSetting.html#method.bind) method.

It supports three types of server sockets:
- UNIX
- TCP
- SSL

Once the object is created, you must call the `accept` method in a loop to accept client connections.
Each accepted connection will create a `Stream` socket, which can be managed just like a client socket.

## Stream

A `Stream` represents a client socket or a socket created by a `StreamListener` when a client connects.
It can be instantiated from a [`TargetSetting`](ch01-02-03-stream.md#client) using the [`connect`](https://docs.rs/prosa/latest/prosa/io/stream/struct.TargetSetting.html#method.connect) method.

It supports several types of client sockets:
- UNIX
- TCP
- SSL
- TCP over HTTP proxy
- SSL over HTTP proxy

You can manually connect using the `connect_*` methods as appropriate.

After creating the socket, you have several options to further configure it, such as:
- `nodelay`
- `ttl`

## IO macro

This section will be documented when the macro becomes stable, or removed if it is not relevant.
