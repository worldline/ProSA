# Foreword

While programming languages continue to change and evolve, the foundational architectural concepts in software development remain steadfast.

This book explores these enduring principles through the lens of ProSA, a project rooted in ideas originally conceived by Michel Roux in COBOL and Java.
Our role has been to take the lead on development, adapting these concepts to the modern Rust language.

The goal of this book and the overarching ProSA initiative is to equip both developers—whether engaged in low-level or high-level development—and operations (OPS) with a framework that supports their projects.

We aim to integrate timeless concepts with modern programming and operational practices, empowering teams to create robust solutions.

Worldline, a vast enterprise with an extensive platform ecosystem, exemplifies the value of full integration.
By providing a product that seamlessly fits into this stack, developers and OPS professionals alike are free to focus on what truly matters: implementing and maintaining their own business solution.

We hope this book offers valuable insights and guidance as you embark on your journey with ProSA.
