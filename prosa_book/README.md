# ProSA Book

This ProSA book is generated with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

To generate the book, you need to have `mdbook` and its dependencies installed first. You can install them using:

```bash
cargo install mdbook mdbook-mermaid
```

## Testing Locally

From the ProSA root directory, you can launch the local server with:

```bash
mdbook serve prosa_book
```

You can then access the book by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
